# Disallows non-null assertions using the `!` postfix operator (no-non-null-assertion)

## Rule Details

Using non-null assertions cancels the benefits of the strict null-checking mode.

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```ts
interface Foo {
  bar?: string;
}

const foo: Foo = getFoo();
const includesBaz: boolean = foo.bar!.includes('baz');
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```ts
interface Foo {
  bar?: string;
}

const foo: Foo = getFoo();
const includesBaz: boolean = foo.bar && foo.bar.includes('baz');

TypeScript's `!` non-null assertion operator asserts to the type system that an expression is non-nullable, as in not `null` or `undefined`.
Using assertions to tell the type system new information is often a sign that code is not fully type-safe.
It's generally better to structure program logic so that TypeScript understands when values may be nullable.

## Examples

<!--tabs-->

### ❌ Incorrect

```ts
interface Example {
  property?: string;
}

declare const example: Example;
const includesBaz = example.property!.includes('baz');
```

### ✅ Correct

```ts
interface Example {
  property?: string;
}

declare const example: Example;
const includesBaz = example.property?.includes('baz') ?? false;

## When Not To Use It

<<<<<<< HEAD
If you don't care about strict null-checking, then you will not need this rule.

=======
If your project does not use the `strictNullChecks` compiler option, this rule is likely useless to you.
If your code is often wildly incorrect with respect to strict null-checking, your code may not yet be ready for this rule.
