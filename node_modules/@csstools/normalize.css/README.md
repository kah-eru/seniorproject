## Differences from `necolas/normalize.css`

Nicolas Gallagher and I started writing normalize.css together. I named and
created the normalize.css repository with the help of Paul Irish and Ben Alman.
I transferred the repository to Nicolas, who turned it into a “household” CSS
library.

Later, I resumed authorship of normalize.css with Luciano Battagliero. Together,
we tagged, deprecated, and removed “opinionated” styles — styles developers
often prefer but which do not fix bugs or “normalize” browser differences.

Later, Nicolas resumed authorship and the issue of whether to include or omit
the opinionated styles forced us to split.

I continue working on the normalize.css project, currently under the “csstools”
tag. I hope one day our differences are resolved and the projects are one again.
